              <p class="pp">Banshidhar Charitable Trust was constituted on 28-06-2019 in memory of Late Banshidharji Bagaria who was born on 5th March, 1936 in Greenwood Tea Estate, Dibrugarh, Assam. He was the fifth child of Late Badridasji Bagaria and Late Ratni Devi Bagaria. Since childhood he has to take up the family responsibility as his father Late Badridasji was suffering from paralysis. In the year 1957, he got married to Srimati Maina Devi Bagaria but soon after his marriage he went to Kolkata to complete his Chartered Accountancy. Soon he became a very very renowned Chartered Accountant in the entire North East India particularly in Assam and earned a very good name for himself through his professional knowledge and kind nature. He was a very pious man and was frequent in visiting various temples. Although he shifted from Greenwood to Dibrugarh Town, he never stopped going to his ancestral house in Greenwood. Late Banshidharji Bagaria and Smt. Maina Devi Bagaria were blessed with five children. Although Late Banshidharji was a person who lived for others, he was careless towards his own health. At the age of 62, he was diagnosed with kidney problems which never got cured. Although he was sick and very weak, he never stopped going to the office and did his regular office work. But at the age of 67 i.e. on 08-09-2003, he passed away after a prolonged illness in Dibrugarh. Although he left us physically but can never leave us mentally. He is mixed amongst the starts shining in the sky. Perhaps they are not the stars but rather openings in Heaven wherefrom the love of our lost ones pour through and shines down upon us to let us know that they are happy. Someone wrote the following few lines for the bereaved family members which are quoted below:</p>
                <br>
                <br>
<p class="pp bb">
"When I am gone, release me, let me go,
<br>
I have so many things to see and do.
<br>
You mustn't tie yourself to me with tears,
<br>
Be happy that we had so many years.
<br>
I gave you my love, you can only guess,
<br>
How much you give to me in happiness.
<br>
I thank you for the love you have shown,
<br>
But now it's time I travelled on alone.
<br>
So grieve a while for me, if grieve you must,
<br>
Then let your grief be comforted by trust.
<br>
It's only for a while what we post part,
<br>
So bless the memories with your heart.
<br>
I won't be far away, for life goes on,
<br>
So if you need me, call and I will come.
<br>
Though you can't see or touch me, I'll be near,
<br>
And if you listen with your heart, you'll hear,
<br>
All of my love around you soft and clear.
<br>
And then when you must come this way alone,
<br>
I'll greet you with a smile, and welcome you home."
